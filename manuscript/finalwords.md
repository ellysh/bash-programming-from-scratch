# Finalwords

Here we finish our introduction to Bash. We have covered the basics of the language only. This book leaves many topics out of the scope. They are required for advanced Bash development. Most probably, you would not need them for daily work with a computer.

These advanced topics can be interesting for you if you want to go deeper in Bash:

* [Manipulating Strings](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/string-manipulation.html).

* [Regular Expressions](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/x17129.html).

* [The `sed` stream editor](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/x23170.html).

* [The `awk` text processing language](https://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/awk.html).

These topics are important. They are material for advanced study. You can skip them if you are using Bash for simple tasks and basic automation. Learn these topics if you are going to write complex applications in Bash.

Perhaps you enjoyed programming. You found it useful. What to do next after reading this book?

First of all, let's admit that Bash is not a general-purpose programming language. This term refers to languages for developing applications in various [**domains**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_(software_engineering)). Such languages do not contain constructs that are suitable for one domain only and useless in another.

Bash is the [**domain-specific language**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language). Does that mean it is useless? No, it does not. Bash is a powerful auxiliary tool for each software developer. Today it is used for integrating large projects, testing, building software and automating routine tasks. You would not find a commercial project written in Bash only. This language copes well with the tasks for which it was created. But it is inferior to modern general-purpose languages in many application domains.

Nobody creates a programming language just for fun. Its author faced some applied tasks. The languages existing at that time were not suitable to solve them. Then this developer wrote the new language that is focused on specific tasks. Therefore, modern general-purpose languages have advantages in a few domains only. No language fits any type of task perfectly. This leads that the applied domain dictates you the language for software development.

So, you have read this book. Now it is time to choose an applied domain that interests you. Read articles on the Internet. Think about it: which area of software development is right for you? Only after answering this question, choose a programming language for further study.

Table 5-1 is your starting point for getting to know the applied domains. It also lists the languages used in them.

| Domain | Programming language |
| --- | --- |
| [Mobile applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app) | Java, C, C++, HTML5, JavaScript |
|  | |
| [Web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) ([front end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_end_and_back_end)) | JavaScript, PHP, HTML5, CSS, SQL |
|  | |
| [Web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) ([back end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_end_and_back_end)) | JavaScript, PHP, Ryby, Perl, C#, Java, Go |
|  | |
| [High Load Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)) | C++, Python, Ruby, SQL |
|  | |
| [System administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_administrator) | Bash, Python, Perl, Ruby |
|  | |
| [Embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system) | C, C++, Ассемблер |
|  | |
| [Machine learning ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) and [data analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis) | Python, Java, C++ |
|  | |
| [Information security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_security) | C, C++, Python, Bash |
|  | |
| [Enterprise software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_software) | Java, C#, C++, SQL |
|  | |
| [Video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game) | C++ |

It is not enough to know a programming language to become a high-class developer. It is necessary to know the technologies that are used in the specific applied domain. For example, an information security expert must understand the architecture of computer networks and operating systems. As you grow professionally, you will come to understand what technologies you need to learn.

Suppose you have chosen your applied domain and programming language. Now it is time to enroll in a free online course. This book has introduced you to the basics of programming. So, learning a new language will go faster. The statements of Python or C++ will seem familiar to you from Bash. However, these languages have concepts that you will have to learn from scratch. Do not lose your motivation. Apply the new knowledge into practice and learn from your mistakes. This is the only way to get results.

I hope you learned something new from this book and had an enjoyable time reading it. If you like the book, please share it with your friends. I would also appreciate it if you would take a few minutes to write a review on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57301128-bash-programming-from-scratch).

If you have any questions or comments about the book, write me to [petrsum@gmail.com](mailto:petrsum@gmail.com). Also, ask questions in the "Issues" section of the [GitHub repository of the book](https://github.com/ellysh/bash-programming-from-scratch/issues).

Thank you for reading "Bash programming from scratch"!
