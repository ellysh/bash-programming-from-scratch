# Introduction

Learning to program is not easy. It is even harder if you start from scratch and learn it on your own without mentors. This task is feasible, but its result depends on you.

You would need a strong motivation to study a new and complex subject. So, consider your goals before you continue reading this book. What do you expect from your new skills? What tasks will your programs solve? Answers to these questions help you to choose an effective way to learn.

If you firmly intend to become a professional programmer in the shortest possible time, you need a mentor. Enroll yourself in a full-time or online course. You accelerate your progress greatly when you communicate directly with the mentor, ask questions, and clarify unclear topics.

You can learn programming without a mentor if just curiosity guides you. Do you want to get a new hobby or learn a new fancy thing? In this case, self-study with the book is the right way. It will bring you practical benefits for relatively small efforts. After all, basic programming skills are useful for anyone who works with the computer. Perhaps this book would be a starting point for you. It will help you to choose a direction for further development.

Today there are plenty of books available in online shops and libraries. A reader with any technical level can find an appropriate book. Is there a reason to write yet another book?

Programming is a practical domain. It has a lot of theory, as mathematics has. But knowing the fundamental principles does not make you a programmer. You have to write a lot of code on your own to become a programmer. At first, this code won't work. Then, it will contain errors. Gradually, you will learn how to anticipate and fix the mistakes in advance. Knowledge of a particular language does not indicate your progress. But an evaluation of your old code does it. When you read your code a month later and notice its disadvantages, it confirms your progress.

So what is wrong with existing books? Many of them focus on a specific language or technology. The chosen theme is considered there in detail. In this case, the author does not pay enough attention to practical exercises. A beginner programmer does not need such a volume of specialized theoretical knowledge. It brings him the wrong idea of how to learn to program. Somebody rarely reads such books for specific technologies from cover to cover. More often, they are used as a reference when a practical question arises.

Books of another type teach you some programming language by examples. When you study such a book, your progress goes faster. But there is one problem here. Many readers do not find the motivation to work with examples. The author offers you to read and understand a lot of code. Often, this code demonstrates a specific principle and does not have a practical use case. So, such examples are not attractive to readers.

Modern general-purpose languages are complex. It means that you should know a lot about the language before dealing with real-life cases. Here we meet a vicious circle. Examples are not interesting because they are useless. But useful real-life cases are too hard to understand.

The approach of this book differs. Book's introduction considers general theory about a computer. Here we pay attention to the reasons for the technical solutions of the past. These solutions have defined the basic functions of a modern computer. Coming from the reasons will help you to learn material easily.

General knowledge of information technology is useful when you start programming in a particular language. You will certainly encounter problems. For example, your program runs too slow or ends up with an error all the time. Knowing the internals of a computer will help you to understand the reasons for such behavior.

After the introduction, we will get acquainted with the Bash programming language. Contrary to popular belief, it is a complex domain-specific language. However, it solves easily and concisely some tasks. We will use these tasks as examples to learn the basic concepts of programming.

First of all, we will consider Bash as a replacement for the graphical user interface. You will get basic operations on files and directories using text commands. It will teach you the minimal syntax of the language. Using this syntax, you will write your first programs in Bash.

Please do not consider learning Bash as a necessary but useless exercise. Every professional programmer faces tasks of automating some processes and executing commands on a Unix-like system. In both cases, Bash knowledge is indispensable.

If you are not able to complete some example or exercise, do not be upset. It means that the book does not disclose material sufficiently. Please [write](mailto:petrsum@gmail.com) to me about this. We will consider it out together.

There is a list of terms at the end of the book. There you can clarify an unknown concept that you met while reading the book.
