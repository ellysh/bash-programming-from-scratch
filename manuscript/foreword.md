# Introduction

Learning to program is not easy. It is even harder if you start from scratch and learn it on your own without mentors. This is a feasible task, but its result depends on you.

You need good motivation for studying a new and complex subject. So, consider your goals before continue reading this book. What do you expect from your new skills? What tasks will your programs solve? Answers to these questions help you to choose an effective way to learn.

If you firmly intend to become a professional programmer in the shortest possible time, you need a mentor. Enroll yourself in a full-time or online course. You accelerate your progress greatly when you communicate directly with mentor, ask questions, and clarify unclear topics.

You can learn programming without a mentor if curiosity guides you. Do you want to get a new hobby or learn a new fancy thing? In this case, self-study with the book is a right way. It will bring you practical benefits for relatively small efforts. After all, basic programming skills are useful for anyone who works with the computer. Perhaps this book would be a starting point for you. It will help you to choose a direction for further development.

Today there are plenty books are available in online shops and libraries. A reader with any technical level can find an appropriate book. Is there a reason to write yet another book?

Programming is a very practical domain. It has a lot of theory, as mathematics has. But knowing the fundamental principles does not make you a programmer. You have to write a lot of code by your own to become a programmer. At first, this code just won't work. Then, it will contain errors. Gradually, you will learn how to anticipate and fix the errors in advance. Knowledge of a particular language does not indicate your progress. But evaluation of your old code does it. When you read your code a month later and notice its disadvantages, it confirms your progress.

So what is wrong with existing books? Many of them focus on a specific language or technology. The chosen theme is considered there in detail. In this case, author does not pay enough attention for practical exercises. A beginner programmer does not need such volume of specialized theoretical knowledge. It brings him a wrong idea of how to learn programming. It is rare that somebody reads such books for specific technologies from cover to cover. More often, they are used as a reference when a practical question arises.

Another type of books teaches some programming language by examples. When you study such book, your progress goes faster. But there is one problem here. Many readers do not find motivation to work with examples. The authors offer you to read and understand a lot of code. Often, this code demonstrates a certain principle and does not have a practical use case. So, such examples are not attractive for readers.

Modern general-purpose languages are complex. This means that you should know a lot about the language before you can deal with a real life example. This is a vicious circle. Examples are not interesting because they are useless. But useful examples are too difficult to understand.

This book offers another approach. Its introduction is very typical. It considers general theory about a computer. Here we pay attention to the reasons for the technical solutions of the past. These solutions have defined the basic functions of a modern computer. Comming from the reasons will help you to learn material easily.

General knowledge of information technology are useful when you start programming in a particular language. You will certainly encounter problems. For example, your program runs too slow or ends up with an error all the time. Knowing internals of a computer will help you to understand the reasons for such behavior.

After the introduction, we will get acquainted with the Bash programming language. Contrary to popular belief, it is a complex domain-specific language. However, it solves easily and concisely some tasks. We will use these tasks as examples and learn the basic concepts of programming.

First of all, we will consider Bash as a replacement for the graphical user interface. You will get basic operations on files and directories using text commands. It will teach you the minimal syntax of the language. This syntax allows you to write your first programs in Bash.

You should not consider learning Bash as a necessary but useless exercise. Believe me, every professional programmer faces tasks of automation some process and executing commands on a Unix-like system. In both cases, Bash knowledge is indispensable.

If you are not able to complete some example or exercise, do not be upset. This means that the material has not been properly disclosed. [Write] (mailto:petrsum@gmail.com) about this to me and we will consider it out together.

There is a list of terms at the end of the book. There you can clarify an unknown concept that you met while reading the book.
