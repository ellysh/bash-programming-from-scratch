# Introduction

Learning to program is not easy. It is even harder if you start from scratch and learn it on your own without mentors. This is a feasible task, but its result depends on you.

You need good motivation for studying a new and complex subject. So, consider your goals before continue reading this book. What do you expect from your new skills? What tasks will your programs solve? Answers to these questions help you to choose an effective way to learn.

If you firmly intend to become a professional programmer in the shortest possible time, you need a mentor. Enroll yourself in a full-time or online course. You accelerate your progress greatly when you communicate directly with mentor, ask questions, and clarify unclear topics.

You can learn programming without a mentor if curiosity guides you. Do you want to get a new hobby or learn a new fancy thing? In this case, self-study with the book is a right way. It will bring you practical benefits for relatively small efforts. After all, basic programming skills are useful for anyone who works with the computer. Perhaps this book would be a starting point for you. It will help you to choose a direction for further development.

Today there are plenty books are available in online shops and libraries. A reader with any technical level can find an appropriate book. Is there a reason to write yet another book?

Programming is a very practical domain. It has a lot of theory, as mathematics has. But knowing the fundamental principles does not make you a programmer. You have to write a lot of code by your own to become a programmer. At first, this code just won't work. Then, it will contain errors. Gradually, you will learn how to anticipate and fix the errors in advance. Knowledge of a particular language does not indicate your progress. But evaluation of your old code does it. When you read your code a month later and notice its disadvantages, it confirms your progress.

So what is wrong with existing books? Many of them are dedicated to a specific language or technology. The chosen theme is considered in all its subtleties and nuances. In this case, the implementation of practical tasks is not given enough attention. A beginner has no need for such a volume of highly specialized theoretical knowledge. In addition, it causes a false idea of how to learn to program. Such books on specific technologies are rarely read from cover to cover. They are used more often as a reference when there is a practical question.

Other books offer to learn some programming language by examples. Learning with them will be much more productive. The problem is that not all readers find motivation to work with examples. The authors offer to read and understand a lot of code. Unfortunately, if this code only demonstrates a certain principle and is not of any practical use, it will be of little interest to the reader. Modern general-purpose languages are complex. This means that you will need to know a lot about the language before you go into real life examples. This is a vicious circle: examples are not interesting because they are useless, but useful examples are still too difficult to understand.

This book offers a different approach. It starts, as usual, with a general theory about how a computer works. In doing so, attention is paid to the reasons for some of the technical solutions of the past that have defined the basic functions of a modern computer. Knowing these reasons will help you better remember the material and understand the subject.

General knowledge of computer technology will be useful when you start to program in a particular language. You will certainly encounter problems. For example, a program runs too slow or ends up with an error all the time. Knowing your computer hardware will help you understand the reasons for this behavior.

Then we will get to know the Bash programming language. Contrary to popular belief, it is a complex subject oriented language. However, it is relatively easy and concise to solve a number of tasks. Using these tasks as an example, we will learn the basic concepts of programming.

First of all, we will consider Bash as a replacement for the graphical user interface. You will learn how to perform basic operations on files and directories using text commands. In this way you will learn the minimal syntax. There will be enough syntax to write programs in Bash.

You should not consider learning Bash as a necessary but useless exercise in practice. Believe me, every professional programmer faces in his work the automation of routine tasks and the execution of commands on Unix systems. In both cases, Bash knowledge is indispensable.

If you do not manage to run some example or exercise, do not be upset. This only means that the material has not been properly disclosed. [Write] (mailto:petrsum@gmail.com) about this to me and we will sort it out together.

At the end of the book there is a list of terms. In it you can clarify an unfamiliar concept that you met while reading this book.
