## Development Tools

In the previous chapter, we typed Bash commands in the terminal window. Then the memory of the terminal process stores these commands. It means that physically the computer's RAM stores them. RAM is a place for the temporary storage of information. Whenever you shut down the computer, this memory is cleared.

The terminal window is not sufficient for program development. You would need a convenient [source code editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-code_editor). This application allows you to create, edit and save source code files on your hard drive. The hard disk stores information for the long-term.

### Source Code Editor

You can write Bash scripts in any text editor. Even the standard Windows application [Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad) fits. But this application is inconvenient for editing the source code. Notepad does not have features for that. Such features can increase your productivity. Try several special editors and choose the one you like.

Here there is a list of three popular source code editors. If none of the three fits you, please look for alternatives on the Internet. There are many editors of this kind.

W> MS Office and its open-source counterpart [LibreOffice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice) are not suitable for writing source code. They save files in binary or [XML-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) formats. Interpreters and compilers cannot read them. They require text files. Text data is the format of source code editors.

[**Notepad++**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notepad%2B%2B) is a fast and minimalistic open-source editor. It runs on Windows only. If you use macOS or Linux, it is better to consider other editors. You can download the latest version of Notepad++ on the [official website](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/).

[**Sublime Text**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sublime_Text) is a proprietary [**cross-platform**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform_software) source code editor. Cross-platform means that the program runs on several OSes and hardware configurations. You can use Sublime Text for free without activation or buying a license. Download it on the [official website](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

[*Visual Studio Code*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Code) is a free cross-platform source code editor from Microsoft. It is open-source software. It means that the program is available for free and without a license. Download the editor on the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

All three editors have the following features for working with source code:

* [Syntax highlighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_highlighting).
* [Auto-complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocomplete).
* Support of commonly used [character encodings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding).

It is possible to edit the source code without these features. But they speed up your work, make it easier to edit the program and find bugs in it. They also help you to get used to the Bash syntax.
