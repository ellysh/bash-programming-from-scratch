## Command Interpreter

Interpreters work in two modes: non-interactive and interactive. In the first mode, the interpreter executes a program. The program is loaded from the disk into RAM. Then it is executed line by line.

In interactive mode, the user types a command in the terminal emulator window. After pressing the Enter key, the command is executed. The interactive mode of the interpreter is called [**command shell**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) or shell.

A command shell is built into the operating system often. It provides access to the settings and functions of the OS. In Linux, the shell allows the following:

* Run programs and system services.
* Control peripherals and internal devices.
* Access the kernel features.
