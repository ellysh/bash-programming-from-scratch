# Bash Shell

Programming is an applied skill. If you want to learn it, you should choose a programming language and solve tasks. This is the only way to get practical skills.

We use the Bash language in this book. This language is convenient for automating computer administration tasks. Here are few examples of what you can do with Bash:

* Create data backups.

* Manipulate [directories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(computing)) and files.

* Run programs and transfer data between them.

Bash was developed in the Unix environment. Therefore, it bears the imprint of the [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy). Despite its roots, you can also use Bash on Windows and macOS.
